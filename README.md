# Regression-from-Scratch
So here is an implementation of linear regression (Linear Model) from scratch 
I have kept in mind few key points
 1- No use of ready made existing libraries 
 2- implementation of algorithm from scratch 
 3 - testing and training on a primitive dataset first so that i can learn implentation from absolute scratch
 4- used a dataset of housing prices consisting of columns and rows to test train and make predictions
